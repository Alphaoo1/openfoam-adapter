# OpenFOAM adapter tutorials

Here you may find tutorials that only require OpenFOAM, the OpenFOAM adapter, and preCICE to run. They are provided here as an easy way to check your installation. You may find more complicated tutorials which combine different simulation software in the [precice/tutorials](tutorials.html) repository.

While the adapter supports conjugate heat transfer, fluid-structure interaction and fluid-fluid coupling, we currently only have the fluid-fluid tutorial in this repository.
