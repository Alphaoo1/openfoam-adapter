# OpenFOAM adapter tutorials

Here you may find tutorials that only require OpenFOAM, the OpenFOAM adapter, and preCICE to run. They are provided here as an easy way to check your installation. You may find more complicated tutorials which combine different simulation software in the [precice/tutorials](https://github.com/precice/tutorials) repository.

While the adapter supports both conjugate heat transfer and fluid-structure interaction, we currently only have FSI tutorials that use non-OpenFOAM solvers for the structural part. Therefore, they are provided there.
